# Data-Analysis-on-Randomly-Data
# Key Columns and Observations:
1. Demographics:
   - Columns: `Name`, `Age`, `Gender`, and `Income`.
   - These could be inputs for analysis.

2. Variables:
   - `Dependent Variable (y)`: A target variable for prediction or analysis.
   - `Independent Variables (x1, x2)`: Potential predictors.

3. Additional Calculations:
   - Certain rows and columns (e.g., `y`, `x1`, `x2`) include derived values, possibly coefficients or residuals.

4. Unused/Empty Data:
   - Some columns and rows have missing or placeholder values.

# Potential Work in Assignments:
This file suggests tasks such as:
- Data Cleaning: Removing or handling missing values.
- Regression Analysis: Using `y`, `x1`, and `x2` to perform linear regression.
- Insights Extraction: Analyzing the relationship between income, age, and other factors.
- Visualization: Creating charts to visualize relationships between variables.
